## Part 1: Strategic Budgeting — Spending the Right Amount

### Why Most Budget Estimates Fall Short

When most investors budget for furnishing their vacation rental, they think about furniture. Maybe they think about some accessories. But they rarely account for the full scope of costs required to get a property guest-ready and keep it performing at a high level.

Here's the truth: **your project has more costs than just furnishings.**

Understanding the complete cost structure is critical for two reasons:
1. **Avoid surprise costs** that blow your budget mid-project
2. **Allocate strategically** across all categories to maximize ROI

Use our **Budget Estimator Tool** to get specific numbers for your property. This section explains the methodology behind those calculations.

### The Complete Cost Categories

Most investors dramatically underestimate total costs because they only think about furniture. Here are all the categories you need to account for:

#### Category 1: Furnishings
**Furniture + Accessories + Finishing Touches**

This is what most people think of first — beds, sofas, dining tables, rugs, curtains, artwork, throw pillows, etc. But it's just one piece of the puzzle.

**What's included:**
- All furniture pieces (beds, seating, tables, storage)
- Window treatments (curtains, blinds, shades)
- Rugs and floor coverings
- Lighting fixtures and lamps
- Artwork and mirrors
- Accessories and finishing touches (pillows, throws, decor objects, greenery)

**Why it matters for ROI:** This is where you create the visual impact that stops the scroll, converts bookings, and creates memorable experiences.

#### Category 2: Logistics & Delivery
**Fuel, Transport, Receiving & Storage**

Someone has to get all those items from the store (or warehouse) to your property. If you're sourcing from multiple vendors — which you almost certainly will be — this adds up fast.

**What's included:**
- Delivery fees from multiple vendors
- Fuel costs for deal hunting and pickups
- Storage fees if items arrive before your property is ready
- Receiving coordination costs

**Why investors miss this:** They see "free shipping" on individual items and don't realize the cumulative cost of coordinating dozens of deliveries.

#### Category 3: Kitchen Equipment & Supplies
**Everything Guests Need for Meals**

Your kitchen needs to be fully functional, not just furnished. Guests expect a complete kitchen.

**What's included:**
- Complete cookware sets (pots, pans, baking sheets)
- Dinnerware for full capacity (plates, bowls, glasses, mugs)
- Utensils, serving pieces, cutting boards, knives
- Small appliances (coffee maker, toaster, blender, etc.)
- Basic supplies (dish soap, sponges, dish towels)

**Why it matters for ROI:** Inadequate kitchen supplies show up in negative reviews and hurt rebooking rates. Don't skimp here.

#### Category 4: Property Management Requirements
**Essential Items Often Overlooked**

Property management companies (and local regulations) typically require certain items that many investors forget to budget for.

**What's included:**
- Towel sets for full capacity (bath, hand, washcloths)
- Linens for all beds (sheets, pillowcases, mattress protectors)
- Cleaning supplies and equipment
- Safety equipment (fire extinguishers, first aid kit, smoke/CO detectors)
- Welcome materials and property guides
- Extra sets of everything for quick turnarounds

**Why investors miss this:** They focus on guest-facing design elements and forget about operational necessities.

#### Category 5: Installation Services
**Professional Labor for Proper Setup**

Unless you're planning to do everything yourself (which can work for small properties but rarely scales well), you'll need professional help.

**What's included:**
- Movers for large furniture pieces
- Furniture assembly for flat-pack items
- Fixture mounting (TVs, shelving, curtain rods, artwork)

**Why it matters:** Poor installation — crooked art, improperly mounted TVs, wobbly furniture — shows in photos and creates safety/liability issues.

#### Category 6: Design Services
**Professional Planning & Procurement**

If you're working with a designer, this covers their services.

**What's included:**
- Design planning and concept development
- Sourcing and procurement
- Project management and coordination
- Styling and placement

**Critical consideration:** Traditional designers often charge lower design fees but mark up furniture significantly. This can lead to inflated furnishings costs if the markup is aggressive.

### Common Budgeting Mistakes to Avoid

#### Mistake #1: Overlooking Furniture Markups When Budgeting

**The Problem:** Many interior designers charge lower design fees but make their real money through furniture markups (often 30-50%). If you don't account for this when budgeting, you can end up with surprises. The issue is that this structure can create a misalignment of incentives — the designer makes more when you spend more on furniture, not necessarily when your property performs better.

**The Result:** If you budget based only on the design fee without considering markup, your actual furnishings costs can be significantly higher than expected. You might end up with a beautifully designed property that doesn't ROI because the total investment exceeded what you could justify.

**The Solution:** Ask upfront how designers structure their fees. If they use furniture markups, factor that into your budget planning from the start. Some designers charge transparent fees and pass through trade discounts, others use markups — either can work, but you need to know which model you're working with and plan accordingly.

#### Mistake #2: Failure to Consider Expense Categories

**The Problem:** You hire someone for "just the design" or "just help picking furniture," but you don't account for all the other categories above. You end up with unexpected costs for delivery, installation, etc.

**The Result:** Your "well-planned" budget balloons, causing unwelcome surprises and stress.

**The Solution:** Use the complete budget framework above. Account for ALL categories, not just furniture and decor.

#### Mistake #3: Not Calibrating Budget to Market Positioning

**The Problem:** You either aim for an arbitrary low number (like $30k or $50k all-in) without considering your competitive set, or you overspend without a strategic framework for what actually drives performance in your market.

**The Result:** Underspending leads to a property that looks generic and cheap, can't differentiate in search results, and struggles with occupancy. Overspending without strategy leads to a beautiful property with mediocre performance and poor ROI. Either way, you've misaligned your investment with market realities.

**The Solution:** Look at your competitive set — the properties you're actually competing against. Your budget should be calibrated to create a property that stands out favorably in that specific context. Use the Budget Estimator Tool and Strategic Spending Guide below to invest strategically, not arbitrarily high or low.

#### Mistake #4: Aggressively Under-Furnishing to Minimize Costs

**The Problem:** You try to furnish your property with the bare minimum number of items — skipping accessories, limiting art, cutting back on throw pillows, leaving surfaces bare, omitting rugs or curtains to save money.

**The Result:** Your property looks incomplete and feels cold in photos. You can't achieve the "magazine effect" that stops the scroll. Spaces photograph poorly because they lack depth and layering. Even if you spent adequately on furniture, the property still underperforms because it doesn't look finished or feel welcoming.

**The Solution:** Understand that accessories, finishing touches, and layering elements are not optional extras — they're essential components of creating spaces that photograph well and convert bookings. The Budget Estimator Tool accounts for all necessary items, not just furniture. Use it to ensure you're furnishing completely, not just minimally.

### Using the Budget Estimator Tool

The **Budget Estimator Tool** takes your property details and provides customized budget recommendations across all categories.

**What you'll input:**
- Property size (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Sleeping capacity

**What you'll get:**
- Room-by-room budget recommendations
- Category-by-category cost breakdown
- Total project budget range
- Item allocation guidance for maximizing ROI

## Part 2: Strategic Spending Guide — Spending Your Budget Wisely

Getting your budget range right is step one. But even with a perfect budget, you can still fail if you spend on the wrong things.

This section will show you exactly where to invest for maximum impact on:
1. **Stopping the scroll** (getting clicks to your listing)
2. **Converting bookings** (turning browsers into bookers)
3. **Creating memorable experiences** (driving reviews, re-bookings, and referrals)

### The Critical Need-to-Haves (By Room)

These are non-negotiable items that you must include in every room. Skipping these will hurt your performance.

#### Bedrooms

**Curtains**
- **Why:** Create privacy, control light, add color/texture, unify the space from front to back
- **Impact on performance:** Properties without proper window treatments feel unfinished in photos and uncomfortable in person

**Rugs**
- **Why:** Define the space, add warmth and texture, anchor furniture groupings, reduce noise
- **Impact on performance:** Rooms without rugs feel cold and bare in photos; they lack the cohesive foundation needed for that magazine effect
- **Note:** Size and quality matter here - don't skimp

**Quality Mattresses**
- **Why:** Sleep quality could be THE most important factor in guest satisfaction
- **Impact on performance:** Bad mattresses generate negative reviews that kill occupancy rates
- **Critical:** Never compromise on mattress quality

**Layered Bedding**
- **Why:** Creates visual appeal in photos, feels luxurious in person
- **Impact on performance:** Helps stop the scroll and contributes to positive reviews; complete layering is essential for magazine effect
- **What to include:** Quality sheets, duvet/comforter, decorative pillows (2-4), throw blanket, bed skirt or platform frame

**Nightstands & Bedside Lighting (Both Sides)**
- **Why:** Functionality and symmetry; guests need surface space and lighting control
- **Impact on performance:** Missing nightstands or asymmetrical setups look incomplete in photos

**Adequate Storage**
- **Why:** Guests need somewhere to unpack; lack of storage generates complaints
- **Impact on performance:** Shows up in reviews when missing
- **What to include:** Dresser, closet with hangers, luggage racks

**Wall Art**
- **Why:** Fills vertical space, adds personality, contributes to theme/cohesion
- **Impact on performance:** Blank walls make spaces feel cold and unfinished

#### Living Rooms

**Area Rug (Properly Sized)**
- **Why:** Anchors the seating area, defines the space, adds warmth
- **Impact on performance:** Wrong rug size is one of the most common arrangement mistakes; it makes spaces feel disconnected
- **Sizing rule:** Front legs of all seating furniture should be on the rug

**Curtains (All Windows)**
- **Why:** Creates visual unity, controls light, adds color and texture
- **Impact on performance:** Essential for that magazine effect; rooms without curtains feel bare and cold

**Seating for Full Capacity**
- **Why:** Groups need to gather comfortably; inadequate seating segregates people
- **Impact on performance:** Appears in negative reviews when insufficient
- **What to include:** Sofa/sectional + accent chairs + ottomans as needed

**Coffee Table + Side Tables**
- **Why:** Functional necessity + surface styling opportunity
- **Impact on performance:** Contributes to magazine effect through styling

**Layered Lighting**
- **Why:** Creates ambiance, highlights design elements, provides functionality
- **What to include:** Overhead/ceiling + floor lamps + table lamps
- **Impact on performance:** Poor lighting kills the mood and shows in photos

**Layered Accessories**
- **Why:** Creates depth, personality, and that "magazine effect"
- **What to include:** Throw pillows, throw blankets, coffee table books, trays, decorative objects
- **Impact on performance:** This is what separates properties that stop the scroll from those that don't

**Wall Art / Mirrors**
- **Why:** Fills vertical space, adds visual interest, can make spaces feel larger
- **Impact on performance:** Essential for avoiding the "cold and generic" trap

#### Dining Areas

**Dining Table Sized for Capacity**
- **Why:** Groups need to eat together; undersized tables force splitting up
- **Impact on performance:** Mentioned in reviews when inadequate
- **Note:** Don't compromise on capacity

**Comfortable Seating for All**
- **Why:** Functionality + comfort matters for meal times
- **Impact on performance:** Uncomfortable dining chairs generate complaints

**Statement Lighting**
- **Why:** Creates focal point, defines the space, adds visual drama
- **Impact on performance:** Makes dining areas photograph beautifully

**Centerpiece/Styling**
- **Why:** Completes the look, adds color and life
- **What to include:** Decorative bowl/tray, seasonal elements, or greenery

#### Kitchens

**Complete Cookware Set**
- **Why:** Guests expect to be able to cook full meals
- **Impact on performance:** Missing items show up in negative reviews
- **What to include:** Pots, pans, baking sheets, mixing bowls, measuring cups/spoons, utensils

**Dinnerware for Full Capacity**
- **Why:** Everyone needs to eat at once
- **What to include:** Dinner plates, salad plates, bowls, mugs, glasses (water, wine)

**Small Appliances**
- **Why:** Expected amenities that impact convenience

- **Why:** Softens the space, adds color/texture
- **Impact on performance:** Kitchens photograph better with window treatments

**Counter Styling**
- **Why:** Contributes to magazine effect
- **What to include:** Attractive canisters, cutting boards, fruit bowl, greenery

### The Power of Accessories: What Brings It All Together

Here's something many DIY investors miss: **accessories are what create the "magazine effect."**

You can have all the right furniture pieces, but without proper accessorizing, your property will look like a furniture showroom instead of a home. And that difference — between "showroom" and "home" — is what determines whether you stop the scroll or get scrolled past.

#### Essential Accessory Categories

**Greenery**
- **Types:** Faux plants (low maintenance), fresh plants (if you have regular maintenance), botanical prints
- **Where:** Entry tables, coffee tables, kitchen counters, bathroom vanities, bedroom dressers, shelving
- **Why it matters:** Brings life and color; softens hard edges; adds organic element

**Pottery & Vessels**
- **Types:** Decorative bowls, vases, planters, jars, urns
- **Where:** Coffee tables, dining tables, console tables, shelving, mantels
- **Why it matters:** Adds texture, height variation, and sculptural interest

**Art**
- **Types:** Framed prints, canvas art, photography, mirrors
- **Where:** Every room needs wall art scaled appropriately to the space
- **Why it matters:** Fills vertical space; creates focal points; reinforces theme and color palette

**Textiles**
- **Types:** Throw pillows, throw blankets, decorative bedding, table runners
- **Where:** Sofas, beds, chairs, dining tables
- **Why it matters:** Adds color, pattern, texture, and coziness

**Books & Paper Goods**
- **Types:** Coffee table books, decorative book stacks, magazines
- **Where:** Coffee tables, side tables, shelving
- **Why it matters:** Adds personality, provides styling layers, gives guests something to browse

**Trays & Styling Elements**
- **Types:** Decorative trays, boxes, candles, sculptural objects
- **Where:** Coffee tables, nightstands, vanities, dining tables
- **Why it matters:** Creates organization and cohesion when styling surfaces

### Strategic Color Selection

Color is one of your most powerful tools for stopping the scroll and creating cohesion. Here's how to use it strategically.

#### Rule #1: Use Pop Colors to Stop the Scroll

In search results, color makes listings stand out. Properties with strategic pops of color get more clicks than all-neutral properties.

**How to do it:**
- Choose 1-2 accent colors that work with your theme and market positioning
- Incorporate these colors through: throw pillows, curtains, area rugs, artwork, accessories
- Make sure the pops appear in multiple rooms for cohesion
- Ensure the colors are visible in your hero photos (the first images potential guests see)

**Examples:**
- Coastal property: Pops of turquoise/aqua in pillows, art, accessories
- Mountain cabin: Rich rust or deep green in throws, curtains, seating
- Modern minimalist: Bold jewel tone accent (emerald, sapphire, amber) in strategic places

#### Rule #2: Master Undertone Matching

Nothing makes a property feel "off" faster than clashing undertones. When your wood tones, metals, and neutrals have mismatched undertones, the space feels disjointed even if people can't articulate why.

**Warm undertones:** Golden, yellow, orange, red bases
- Wood: Oak, pine, walnut with golden tones
- Metals: Gold, brass, bronze, copper
- Neutrals: Cream, beige, warm gray, tan

**Cool undertones:** Blue, green, purple bases
- Wood: Maple, ash, gray-washed woods
- Metals: Silver, chrome, nickel, matte black
- Neutrals: Pure white, cool gray, blue-gray

**How to do it:**
- Decide on a warm or cool undertone palette (or balanced neutral)
- Ensure all major wood pieces share undertones
- Keep metal finishes consistent throughout the property
- Choose neutrals (paint colors, large furniture pieces) that align with your undertone choice

#### Rule #3: Balance Color and Contrast

Too much contrast creates visual chaos. Too little creates boring, flat spaces that don't photograph well or stop the scroll.

**The sweet spot:**
- 60% dominant color (usually a neutral - your walls, large furniture pieces)
- 30% secondary color (complementary neutral or subtle color - rugs, curtains, some furniture)
- 10% accent colors (your pops - pillows, art, accessories)
- Rules were made to be broken, so gut check your color balance and depart from these ratios when it feels right.

**Contrast strategies:**
- Light walls + medium furniture + dark accents
- Dark walls + light furniture + medium and bright accents
- Monochromatic with texture variation + one punchy accent color

### Common Strategic Spending Mistakes

#### Mistake #1: Buying Cheap Furniture to Save Money

**Why it's tempting:** You're trying to maximize short-term savings and cheap options seem "good enough."

**Why it's a mistake:** Cheap furniture breaks down, wears out, or looks dated quickly in a high-use vacation rental environment. You end up paying for replacements within 2-3 years — sometimes spending as much as or more than if you'd purchased durable pieces originally. Plus, worn-out furniture shows up in photos and reviews, hurting your occupancy during those replacement years.

**The fix:** Invest in durable, quality pieces for high-use items (sofas, beds, dining chairs). These are the foundation of your property and will be used heavily by guests. You can optimize costs on accessories and decor items that are easier and less expensive to replace or refresh.

#### Mistake #2: Cheap Mattresses

**Why it's tempting:** Mattresses are expensive and guests don't see them in photos.

**Why it's a mistake:** Sleep quality is THE #1 driver of guest satisfaction. Bad mattresses generate negative reviews that kill occupancy. Every dollar saved on a cheap mattress costs you exponentially in lost bookings.

**The fix:** This is arguably your single most important per-item investment. Never compromise on mattress quality.

#### Mistake #3: Skimping on the Kitchen

**Why it's tempting:** Guests aren't booking for the kitchen supplies.

**Why it's a mistake:** Guests expect full kitchen functionality. Missing cookware, insufficient dinnerware, cheap knives, and poor small appliances lead to complaints and lower review scores.

**The fix:** Budget adequately for complete kitchen equipment. Buy quality items that will last and meet guest expectations.

#### Mistake #4: Skipping the Need-to-Haves

**Why it's tempting:** Trying to hit a low budget number by cutting curtains, rugs, or accessories.

**Why it's a mistake:** These items are critical for the magazine effect and make spaces feel complete. Without them, your property looks bare and unfinished, killing your ability to stop the scroll and convert bookings.

**The fix:** Use the need-to-haves checklist above. Don't skip items just to hit a lower number.

#### Mistake #5: Overspending on Statement Pieces That Don't Drive Bookings

**Why it's tempting:** That $10,000 custom dining table or $2,000 designer pendant light looks amazing.

**Why it's a mistake:** Guests rarely notice or value individual high-end pieces. They notice the overall effect. You can achieve the same visual impact with strategic mid-range pieces plus excellent styling.

**The fix:** Save on individual furniture pieces, invest in layering and accessories. A $800 dining table with great styling looks as good in photos as a $10,000 table alone.

### The Power of Themes (And How to Do Them Right)

One of the most effective ways to stop the scroll and create memorable experiences is through theming. The best part? **themes don't have to cost more.**

Themes are really about cohesive creative vision and strategic selection, not about spending more money.

#### What Makes a Good Theme

**1. It's distinctive and stands out from your competition** (Zig when they zag)
- Good themes differentiate you in search results
- Look at what your competitors are doing and do something different
- Even if you use a popular theme, find a fresh angle or twist

**2. It's distinctive but not gimmicky**
- Should feel special without being over-the-top
- Guests should feel transported, not like they're in a theme park
- Good: "Refined Coastal Retreat" with natural textures (linen, jute, weathered wood), subtle nautical touches (rope accents, driftwood art), sophisticated sea-inspired color palette (sand, sage, soft blue-gray)
- Bad: "Beach Shack Bonanza" with plastic fish netting on walls, overtly nautical patterns, shell-covered everything, and aggressive blue-and-white stripes throughout

**3. It creates a feeling, not just a look**
- Think about what feeling you want guests to have
- Choose theme elements that evoke that feeling
- Examples: Cozy, Adventurous, Sophisticated, Playful, Serene

**4. It can be property-wide or room-specific**
- You don't need one theme throughout the entire property
- A cohesive overall aesthetic with themed rooms is a powerful combination
- Example: Modern farmhouse aesthetic throughout with a whimsical woodland bunk room

#### Theme Execution on a Budget

**Free or low-cost theme strategies:**
- **Color palette:** Choose 3-4 colors that evoke your theme; use consistently
- **Art selection:** Choose prints/photos that reinforce your theme
- **Accessories:** Greenery, pottery, books, and textiles in theme-appropriate styles

**Higher-impact investments:**
- **One themed room:** Put extra budget into making one space (like a bunk room) really special with theming
- **Entry moment:** First impression matters - invest in making your entryway clearly establish the theme
- **Hero photo spaces:** Prioritize theme execution in the rooms that will be your primary listing photos

## Part 3: Strategic Placement Guide — Spending Your Space Wisely

You've set the right budget. You've purchased the right items. Now comes the moment of truth: arranging everything in your space.

This is where many DIY investors often hit a wall. Because **how you arrange your furniture and style your surfaces determines whether your property photographs well, feels good in person, and creates those memorable experiences that drive re-bookings and reviews.**

Let's break down the core design principles and best practices that will help you arrange your space for maximum impact.

### Core Design Principles

#### Principle #1: Proportion and Scale

**What it means:** The size relationships between objects in a space.

**Why it matters:** Proportion affects how comfortable and harmonious a space feels. When proportions are off, people feel it as awkwardness even if they can't articulate what's wrong.

**Common proportion mistakes:**
- Tiny artwork above a large sofa (looks lost and creates imbalance)
- Oversized furniture in a small room (makes space feel cramped)
- Coffee table too small or large for the seating arrangement (disrupts visual balance)
- Nightstands that don't relate to bed height (looks disconnected)
- Undersized rugs that don't anchor the furniture grouping
- Lamps that are too small or large for the tables they sit on
- Dining chandeliers that overwhelm or get lost above the table

#### Principle #2: Symmetry and Balance

**What it means:** Creating visual equilibrium in a space, either through mirror-image symmetry or asymmetrical balance.

**Why it matters:** Balanced spaces feel calm, intentional, and complete. Imbalanced spaces feel chaotic or unfinished.

**Common balance mistakes:**
- Asymmetrical nightstand arrangements (one side has a nightstand and lamp, the other doesn't)
- Imbalanced wall arrangements (heavy artwork on one side, nothing on the other)
- Off-center focal points that create visual tension

#### Principle #3: Negative Space

**What it means:** The empty space around and between design elements.

**Why it matters:** Negative space gives the eye a place to rest. Too little negative space feels cluttered and chaotic. Too much feels empty and cold.

**Common negative space mistakes:**
- Filling every surface with accessories (too little negative space)
- Leaving large wall areas completely blank (too much negative space)
- Pushing all furniture against walls (creates too much negative space in the center)
- Cluttered surfaces with no breathing room
- Every wall decorated uniformly instead of creating focal points

#### Principle #4: Layering and Unification

**What it means:** Creating depth and cohesion through overlapping design elements. Layering applies at every scale - from full-room furniture arrangements down to how you style a single coffee table.

**Why it matters:** Layering is what creates that cozy, magazine-worthy, "complete" feeling. Spaces without layering feel flat and unfinished. Unifying elements tie separate pieces together into a cohesive whole.

This is a critical principle for creating spaces that photograph beautifully and feel good in person.

**Layering at room scale includes:**
- Foundation elements (rugs and curtains) that anchor and unify
- Primary furniture that defines function
- Secondary furniture that supports the primary pieces
- Lighting that creates ambiance
- Textiles that add color, pattern, and texture
- Accessories that create depth and personality

**Layering at surface scale includes:**
- Base elements (trays, large books) that create foundation
- Height variation (tall, medium, short objects)
- Multiple textures (pottery, greenery, books)
- Overlapping or grouped arrangements rather than evenly spaced items

**Common layering mistakes:**
- Rugs too small to unify furniture groupings (front legs should be on the rug)
- Curtains hung too low or too short, losing their unifying effect
- Missing textiles (no throw pillows, blankets, or softness)
- Skipping accessories (spaces feel incomplete and don't photograph well)
- Surface styling with everything the same height or evenly spaced (creates flatness)
- Not connecting layers cohesively (each element feels random rather than intentional)

#### Principle #5: Space Flow and Partitioning

**What it means:** How the arrangement of furniture and design elements encourages movement through a space or creates separation between areas.

**Why it matters:** Good flow brings people together naturally and makes spaces feel comfortable and functional. Poor flow segregates people, creates awkward spaces, and makes areas feel unusable.

**Common flow mistakes:**
- Seating arranged too far apart for comfortable conversation
- Furniture blocking natural walkways
- Conversation areas interrupted by traffic patterns
- Missing focal points when entering rooms
- Seating that faces walls instead of each other or focal points

### The Most Common Arrangement Mistakes

These are the mistakes that show up most frequently and have the biggest impact on how your property photographs and feels:

**Incorrect curtain height.** Either too low (bunching up on the floor) or too high above the ground (looking like they're wading through water). Both undermine the polished look curtains should create.

**Incorrect rug placement and orientation.** Rugs should unify furniture groupings and define spaces, but incorrect orientation works against this. For example, with beds: the rug should be perpendicular to the bed (running widthwise under and beyond the bed). When the rug runs parallel to the bed instead (lengthwise), the visual relationship feels off and the space feels constrained. The rug fails to properly anchor and frame the furniture.

**Accessorizing as an afterthought.** Not putting the same care into finishing touches that you put into furniture arrangements. When accessories aren't properly balanced or spaced on surfaces, people won't necessarily know why the space feels off, but it will feel off. The design principles above apply to surface styling just as much as room arrangements.

**Poor proportion between objects.** A tiny painting above a large furniture piece looks lost and creates imbalance. When the scale relationship between objects is wrong, the whole space feels awkward.
