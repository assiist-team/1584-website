# How to Add $20,000+ in Annual Cash Flow to Your Vacation Rental While Minimizing Risk Using Interior Design

## Intro

If you're a vacation rental investor, you already know that short-term rentals can be an incredible investment vehicle.

But here's the harsh reality: if you don't furnish them right, instead of generating cash flow, they can actually cost you money. Month after month. Year after year.

And here's what makes this especially frustrating: you're going to have to furnish your property no matter what. Nobody's going to book a property with no furniture in it. Nobody's going to make money from an empty space.

So the only question is: HOW are you going to furnish it?

Because that decision — how you furnish and design your property — is what determines whether you're stuck at 45% occupancy, barely breaking even or operating in the red... or whether you're sitting at 60-65% occupancy, generating an additional $20,000+ in annual cash flow.

Now, if you want your property to generate that kind of cash flow instead of bleeding money, there are two critical KPIs you need to nail:

**Average Daily Rate (ADR)** and **Occupancy Rate**.

These are the levers that determine whether your property is a winner or a money pit.

But here's where most investors go wrong when trying to maximize these numbers: they make three expensive mistakes that kill their ADR and occupancy before they even get started.

What I'm going to share with you today is the exact method we've used to help our clients increase their occupancy rates significantly while also improving their ADR — taking properties from barely breaking even or even losing money to generating strong, consistent cash flow.

That's the difference between a property that's barely breaking even and one that's generating an additional $20,000+ in annual cash flow. And that's in addition to the increase in enterprise value — which is the value of your vacation rental as a cash-generating asset, beyond its real estate value — which could add another $80,000+. Take those two together, and that's over $100,000 in total gains in year one from an investment in interior design. IF you do it right.

And that's exactly what we're going to show you how to do. We call it the ROI Design Method, and we've developed it over the course of 30+ years in the interior design industry.

Our hope is that it'll help you boost your own ADR and occupancy rates so you can focus on building your portfolio, spending more time with your family, and enjoying your life instead of worrying about your property's performance.

But before I give it to you, let me quickly walk you through the numbers behind the claims I just made so that we're on the same page about the upside here and whether or not this could make sense for you.

Because you're an investor, and as one I assume you make decisions based on the numbers.

## The Numbers

Let's say you have an under-performing rental property with an ADR of $200/night at an average occupancy of 45%, which is below average for most competitive markets.

If that property has a $30k annual mortgage and other fixed costs totaling around $50k, and your property management company is charging 15%, your cash flow would be in the negative by about $10k per year with this underperforming property. Not the worst situation to be in, but definitely not what you signed up for, right?

Now let's take a look at what would happen if you used strategic interior design to increase your ADR to $240/night and your occupancy to 65%.

This would place you well above average in your market — not even in the top 10%, just solidly above average. A realistic, achievable goal.

Well, if you did this, you'd add over $25k in cash flow so that you're now $15k+ in the green. That's much nicer than being in the red, but it gets better.

Now, you probably already know that a vacation rental that has a proven track record of positive cash flow and hands-free management can sell for not just the real estate value but also the enterprise value, which you can get from your SDE — seller discretionary earnings.

We get that by adding back our financing costs (mortgage principal and interest) and operator pay (property management fee).

Then you apply a multiple — 3 is probably fair here — to get your enterprise value.

When we do this, our enterprise value more than doubles, a gain of over $80k.

If we combine that with our cash flow increase, our year 1 gain for this property is over $105k for the first year after investing in interior design services.

Hopefully this example gives you a sense of the impact that interior design can have on your cash flow through an increase in ADR and Occupancy, and to give you a sense of how this has helped real investors, let's take a look at what some of our clients have said to us:

Now, of course the results you get will depend on other things besides interior design, like your location, amenities, etc., but if you have those other things dialed in, how a property is furnished is usually what makes or breaks its performance in a healthy market.

I'll give you free access a tool at the end where you can plug in your own property to see how your numbers look, so stay with me if you want access to that.

Now, there's a right way to do things if you want results like this, and that starts by understanding the underlying problem and where investors usually go wrong.



## Where Most Investors Go Wrong

And where most investors go wrong when furnishing their properties is by making one of three expensive mistakes that impact their ADR and occupancy.

Our ROI Design Method is essentially built around helping you avoid these three mistakes so you can maximize your property's cash flow.

### Mistake #1: Spending the Wrong Amount

The first mistake is **spending the wrong amount**.

You're an investor, so I shouldn't have to tell you not to over-spend, but there are some sneaky traps that make it easy to do this. For example, if you work with a designer who makes their money on furniture markups, they might charge less up-front but you might over-pay on furnishings because incentives aren't aligned. Or if you try to furnish your property yourself without knowing where to draw the line with each space and each piece, it's easy to end up with a budget that balloons beyond what you can justify and what's gonna ROI.

What's more common is for investors to underspend. It's easy to think that the smart thing to do is to get the place furnished for as little as possible. But it's really easy to be penny wise and pound foolish here because a barebones furnishings budget makes it hard to stand out in your market, leading to lower occupancy and daily rates. When people do book, cheap furnishings leave a bad taste and impact your re-bookings, referrals, and reviews, leading again to lower occupancy rates. Where things really get painful, though, is that cheap furnishings result in higher replacement costs long-term, so you can end up paying as much as or more than someone who followed the ROI Design Method but without any of the benefits.

### Mistake #2: Spending on the Wrong Things

The second mistake is **spending on the wrong things**.

Let's say you've chosen a budget range that isn't too high or too low. You're still not through the woods, because you can still spend money on the wrong things.

See, when it comes to maximizing your ADR and occupancy, you need to understand that there are three critical stages in the guest journey where design makes or breaks your performance:

**First, you have to stop the scroll.**

When potential guests are browsing Airbnb or VRBO, your listing photos are competing with dozens of other properties. If you don't stand out compared to your competition, if people don't stop scrolling and click on your listing to get to your booking page, then they'll never book. It doesn't matter how great your property is if nobody ever sees it.

This is where strategic spending on high-impact visual elements becomes critical. 

One way to stop the scroll is with colors that pop — cohesively incorporated into curtains, rugs, throw pillows, and other design elements. Colors stand out in search.

Another way is with interesting thematic elements, like an alpine cabin themed bunk room or a Morrocan retreat bedroom. Themes stand out in search.

And then there are properties that are so well-put-together — where your photos look like they're straight out of Architectural Digest — that they stop the scroll with that "magazine effect." This comes down to making sure your design elements are cohesive, properly laid out, and that your finishing touches are in place. You'd be surprised how much your choice in curtain panels, throw pillows, or wall art can affect how many clicks you get on your listing.

**Second, you have to give people a reason to choose your property over other properties.**

Once they've clicked through to your listing, you need to convert that interest into a booking. This is where offering a unique experience becomes crucial. Those thematic elements we talked about? They don't just stop the scroll — they also give people a reason to choose your property. Same with that magazine effect that comes from cohesive design elements that are properly laid out.

You want to create spaces that not only look stunning in photos but also signal to potential guests that staying at your property will be special — that it will give them the escape from the world they're looking for and help them form the kind of lasting memories they want to create with the people they love.

**Third, you have to make it memorable - in a good way.**

This is about the actual experience when guests stay at your property. Because here's what some investors don't pay enough attention to: your occupancy rate isn't just about getting people to book once. It's about getting them to rebook, leave glowing 5-star reviews that convert future guests, and refer their friends and family to your property.

Reviews like these that our clients have gotten on their properties:

And this is where spending on the wrong things can really hurt you.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, was famous for using inversion as a problem-solving technique. He'd say: "Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there." In other words, figure out what causes failure, then do the opposite.

So let's invert: What makes a vacation rental property memorable in a BAD way?

#1 Bad sleep. Uncomfortable mattresses. Scratchy sheets. Bedrooms that feel cramped or unwelcoming. When guests are paying premium prices to stay somewhere special, a poor sleep experience colors their entire vacation — and they remember it in their reviews.

#2 Layouts that segregate instead of connect. A property that sleeps 14 but only has comfortable seating for 10. Dining tables that can't fit everyone for meals. Spaces that force groups to split up rather than come together. Layouts that feel awkward and don't facilitate the natural flow of conversation and interaction that creates those special vacation moments.

#3 Generic, cold design. Spaces that look like they could be anywhere — missing that cohesive, magazine-worthy quality that makes a property feel special. No thematic elements that give the property a unique identity. Design that feels cold and impersonal rather than cozy and welcoming. Spaces that are just functional rather than creating that "I'm actually IN the magazine" feeling that makes guests excited to be there and eager to share photos.

These are the things that lead to mediocre reviews, one-time bookings, and properties that struggle to maintain occupancy.

So if we want to do the OPPOSITE — if we want to make properties memorable in a GOOD way — we need to invest strategically in:

- Quality sleep experiences. Premium mattresses, quality linens, bedrooms that feel cozy and inviting — because guests remember when they sleep well, and it sets the tone for their entire stay.
- Spaces and layouts designed for connection. Adequate seating and dining for your property's full capacity. Living areas that naturally bring people together and encourage those memory-making moments — the morning coffee conversations, the group dinners, the late-night game sessions.
- Cohesive, distinctive design that creates the magazine effect. Thematic elements that give your property a unique identity. Design choices that make spaces feel cozy, special, and Instagram-worthy — the kind of places guests are excited to stay in, photograph, and tell their friends about.

When you invest in these things — when you spend on what actually matters to the guest experience — you create properties where people feel good. Where they make memories. Where they want to come back.

And THAT'S what drives re-bookings, 5-star reviews, and referrals. That's what keeps your occupancy rate high year after year.

The truth is that investing in some items will move the needle more for your rental than others, so you want to spend strategically based on what actually impacts those three critical stages: stopping the scroll, converting browsers into bookers, and creating memorable experiences that generate long-term occupancy.

### Mistake #3: Spending Their Space Currency the Wrong Way

The third mistake is **spending their space currency the wrong way** — and this might be the most important one because it's where people most commonly drop the ball.

Here's what I mean: let's assume you get some help choosing all of the items that are gonna go into your rental. You've got everything in the garage and inside you've got empty floors, blank walls, and bare windows. All of this blank space is your space currency — and how you spend it determines EVERYTHING.

It's kind of like painting. You can have all the right paints chosen by someone who really understands color, but you can end up with a terrible painting or a beautiful painting depending on how you use them.

The same furniture, art, and decor can create completely different results based on how it's arranged.

And here's why this matters so much: how you spend your space currency impacts ALL THREE critical stages we talked about.

**It affects stopping the scroll.** Poor arrangement means your photos lack that magazine effect — spaces don't photograph well, compositions feel off, the cohesiveness isn't there. Properties that should stop the scroll get scrolled right past.

**It affects converting bookings.** When browsers look through your listing photos, they can tell when something feels off even if they can't articulate why. Spaces that look cold instead of cozy. Layouts that feel awkward. Design that's generic instead of distinctive and memorable. These things make potential guests keep looking at other properties.

**And it affects the actual experience.** Wwhen you're in a space that's arranged well, it feels good. Science backs this up — beautifully designed spaces help people relax, make them more optimistic, and literally change their physiological state. And that feeling is what creates memories. Because the core of any memory isn't just what happened — it's how it felt.

Poor arrangement does the opposite. Spaces that feel off. Layouts that segregate people instead of bringing them together. Coldness instead of coziness. All of this determines not just how memorable the experience is, but HOW it's remembered — what shows up in reviews, whether guests rebook, and whether they tell their friends about your property.

You can have the perfect budget and all the right pieces, but if you don't know how to arrange furniture to create inviting spaces that bring people together, how to style surfaces to achieve that magazine effect, how to layer textures to make spaces feel cozy and cohesive instead of cold and generic, or how to create layouts that naturally facilitate interaction and memory-making — your property will still underperform.

This is where a lot of DIY investors hit a wall. They think choosing the right items is enough. They've made good choices on budget and items, but the final result looks like a furniture showroom instead of a home. It doesn't photograph well. It doesn't make guests feel comfortable. And it doesn't drive the occupancy rates they need.

So we want to avoid these three mistakes if we want to maximize the ROI we get from investing in interior design.

## The ROI Design Method

Which is where the ROI Design Method comes in. 

It's our set of best practices around how to avoid the mistakes above and maximize your ROI in interior design so that you get the best ADR and occupancy rates possible for your property, which means more cash flow and consistent performance from your rental year after year.

The ROI Design Method has three core components that directly address the three mistakes we just covered:

**Strategic Budget** — knowing exactly how much to invest based on your market, your property type, and your financial goals.

**Strategic Spending** — knowing where to invest for maximum impact on stopping the scroll, converting bookings, and creating memorable experiences.

**Strategic Placement** — knowing how to arrange and style your space to create that magazine effect in photos and that welcoming, memory-making feeling in person.

If you stay until the end of this short video, I'm gonna give you this method in the form of a free toolkit that includes:

- Budget Estimator
- Strategic Spending Guide
- Strategic Placement Guide
- ROI Calculator

## The Tale of Three Properties

Those messages aren't just compliments — they're proof that the ROI Design Method works in the real world. And to really see why, it helps to look at the different approaches investors take when it comes to designing their properties.

Let me illustrate what that looks like with a story I call the Tale of Three Properties…

### Property 1: The Penny Pincher

This investor heard they can furnish their property for $50,000, all-in. They want to keep costs down, get it done fast, get the property online.

But here's what really happens:

To hit that number, they pinch pennies on furnishings and accessories. The property ends up looking like everyone else's. Generic. Forgettable. It doesn't stand out in search results, and it doesn't deliver a memorable experience in person.

The photos are flat. The space feels cheap. Guests scroll right past it — or worse, they book it once and never come back.

The result? The property sits at $200/night and 40-45% occupancy. It's functional, but it's not compelling. And in a competitive market, that means it's bleeding potential revenue every single month — or operating in the red.

### Property 2: The Over-spender

On the other end of the spectrum, we have the over-spender. This can happen in two ways:

Sometimes they hire a designer who charges low upfront but makes real money on furniture markups — pushing expensive pieces that look great but don't actually drive more bookings.

Other times, the investor does it themselves and overspends because they don't know where to invest for maximum impact. They drop thousands on statement pieces that don't photograph well or don't matter to guests, while overlooking the details that actually drive clicks and conversions.

Either way, the budget balloons, but the occupancy rate doesn't budge proportionally. The property might be beautiful, but it's not strategically designed to win bookings. So they're still sitting at $210/night and 50-55% occupancy — better than the penny pincher, but not enough to justify the investment.

### Property 3: The ROI Design Investor

And then there's the ROI Design Investor.

This investor doesn't swing to either extreme. They're strategic. They know the goal isn't to spend the least or the most — it's to spend in the right places to maximize ADR and occupancy.

They use the ROI Design Method to:

- Invest strategically in the elements that stop the scroll and make properties irresistible in photos
- Design spaces that give potential guests a compelling reason to choose their property — through unique experiences, cohesive aesthetics, and that magazine effect
- Create memorable experiences that generate 5-star reviews, re-bookings, and referrals — through quality sleep, adequate comfortable seating, and layouts that encourage memory-making
- Save in areas that don't affect bookability or guest satisfaction

Because here's the truth: the best investors know that success comes from judgment calls — where to push, where to pull back, and how to use every dollar to drive more nights booked at higher rates.

When those decisions are made wisely, the property doesn't just look amazing — it performs. It gets clicked on more. It gets booked more. It earns more 5-star reviews. And it jumps from $200/night at 45% occupancy to $240/night at 65% occupancy.

That's 20 additional percentage points of occupancy PLUS a $40 increase in nightly rate. That's an extra 70+ nights booked per year at a higher rate. And that could mean an extra $20,000 to $25,000+ in annual revenue from the same property.

## Fulfilling on the Intro's Promise

Now, let's circle back to that bold claim from the start — that we can help you increase your ADR and occupancy to generate an additional $20,000+ in annual cash flow. Here's how the ROI Design Method actually delivers that:

**First: Photos That Stop the Scroll**

We design spaces that photograph exceptionally well — spaces with that magazine effect that makes people pause mid-scroll. That means more clicks, more interest, and more booking inquiries. If guests don't click, you don't get booked — period.

**Second: Design That Converts Browsers into Bookers**

We create spaces that give potential guests a compelling reason to choose your property over the competition. Through strategic use of themes, cohesive design elements, and beautiful styling, we make your property stand out as the obvious choice.

**Third: Experiences That Drive Reviews, Re-bookings, and Referrals**

We design for the guest experience in ways that make people feel something. Where they get great sleep. Where large groups can comfortably gather for meals and socializing. Where the layout naturally encourages them to make the kind of lasting memories they came on vacation to create. That translates directly into 5-star reviews, which boost your ranking, increase your visibility, and drive even more bookings over time — plus re-bookings and referrals that keep your occupancy high.

**Fourth: Strategic Design That Maximizes Every Dollar**

We know exactly where to invest for maximum impact on bookability — and where you can save without hurting performance. That means:

- Trade discounts that lower your costs
- Smart sourcing that finds high-impact pieces at better prices
- Strategic choices that prioritize what actually drives ADR and occupancy

Yes, we charge for our services, and we're not cheap. But our clients see the ROI clearly: higher ADR, higher occupancy, more revenue, and properties that outperform the market year after year.

It's kind of like hiring a great property manager who increases your bookings — except instead of taking a percentage every month, you invest once and reap the benefits for years.
