# How to Maximize Cash Flow from Your Vacation Rental While Minimizing Risk Using Interior Design

## Intro

If you're a vacation rental investor, you already know that short-term rentals can be an incredible investment vehicle.

But here's the harsh reality: if you don't do them right, instead of generating cash flow, they can actually cost you money. Month after month. Year after year.

And here's what makes this especially frustrating: you're going to have to furnish your property no matter what. Nobody's going to book a property with no furniture in it. Nobody's going to make money from an empty space.

So the only question is: HOW are you going to furnish it?

Because that decision — how you furnish and design your property — is what determines whether your property underperforms, barely breaking even or operating in the red... or whether it becomes a top performer in your market, consistently generating strong cash flow.

Now, if you want to maximize your property's cash flow, there are two critical KPIs you need to nail:

**Average Daily Rate (ADR)** and **Occupancy Rate**.

These are the levers that determine whether your property is a winner or a money pit.

But here's where most investors go wrong when trying to maximize these numbers: they make three expensive mistakes that kill their ADR and occupancy before they even get started.

And if you want to maximize your ADR and occupancy — if you want your property to generate the kind of cash flow you're looking for — you need to avoid these mistakes and follow a proven framework.

What I'm going to share with you today is the exact method we've used to help our clients increase their occupancy rates by 20 percentage points while also improving their ADR — taking properties from barely breaking even or even losing money to generating strong, consistent cash flow and significantly increasing their enterprise value.

We call it the ROI Design Method, and we've developed it over the course of 30+ years in the interior design industry.

Our hope is that it'll help you boost your own ADR and occupancy rates so you can focus on building your portfolio, spending more time with your family, and enjoying your life instead of worrying about your property's performance.

But before I walk you through this framework, let me quickly explain why ADR and occupancy matter so much and how even modest improvements in these metrics can dramatically impact your bottom line.

Because you're an investor, and as one I assume you make decisions based on the numbers.

## Why ADR and Occupancy Matter

Here's why these two metrics are so critical:

Your revenue is simply your ADR multiplied by your number of booked nights. So if you want to increase revenue, you need to either increase your nightly rate, increase your occupancy, or ideally, both.

And here's what makes interior design such a powerful lever: it's one of the few things you can control that impacts BOTH metrics simultaneously.

Strategic design can justify higher nightly rates because your property stands out and offers a superior experience. And that same strategic design increases occupancy because more people click on your listing, more browsers convert into bookers, and more guests leave 5-star reviews that drive future bookings.

This is why even modest improvements in these metrics can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in additional annual revenue.

Let me show you a quick example of how the math works:

Let's say you have a property with a current ADR and occupancy that puts you in the bottom half of your market. If that property has typical vacation rental expenses — mortgage, utilities, maintenance, property management fees — there's a good chance you're either barely breaking even or operating at a loss.

But if you use strategic interior design to boost your ADR and occupancy to put you in the top tier of your market — not even #1, just solidly above average — you could add $20,000 to $30,000+ in annual cash flow.

And when you factor in the enterprise value increase that comes from having a property with a proven track record of strong cash flow, your total year-one gain could easily exceed $100,000.

Now this is a simplified example based on realistic scenarios. Let me show you a few examples of how this has actually worked for our clients:

*social proof*

Now, of course the results you get will depend on other things outside of your designer's control, like your local market dynamics, your real estate photographer, etc., but these examples should help you understand when and why it makes sense to invest in interior design.

I'll give you a tool where you can plug in your own property's numbers to see how your specific situation would shake out if you stay til the end, so stay with me if that would be helpful.

Now, there's a right way to do things if you want results like this, and it's important to understand the underlying problem and where investors usually go wrong if you want to be successful with this.

## Clarifying the Problem

You already know that vacation rentals are an incredible investment if you do it right. But the harsh truth is that you can easily lose money if you do it wrong.

If you've done your market research well and you have your operations figured out, where the wagon falls off the rails is usually whether or not your property stands out in your market.

I'm not saying you're guaranteed to be in the red if you don't stand out, but you will 100% get fewer clicks, fewer bookings, and have a property that sits empty more often than it should.

And even when people do book, if your property doesn't make them feel good — if it doesn't help them create lasting memories — they won't come back. They won't tell their friends. And they won't leave you critical 5-star reviews that build momentum and keep your property booked.

The best case scenario is that you get modest cash flow but leave substantial money on the table. The worst case scenario is that you operate in the negative and your property becomes a constant source of stress.

There's no reason to settle for either of these outcomes.

So the primary problem we're trying to solve here is risk management. The secondary problem is maximizing your cash flow and enterprise value.

## Where Most Investors Go Wrong

Now, where most investors go wrong is by making one of three expensive mistakes when they furnish their properties.

And these mistakes directly sabotage their ability to maximize ADR and occupancy.

The first mistake is **spending the wrong amount**.

The second mistake is **spending on the wrong things**.

The third mistake is **spending their space currency the wrong way**, and we'll talk about what that means shortly.

Our ROI Design Method is essentially built around helping you avoid these three mistakes so you can maximize your returns.

### Mistake #1: Spending the Wrong Amount

You're an investor, so I shouldn't have to tell you not to over-spend, but there are some sneaky traps that make it easy to do this. For example, if you work with a designer who makes their money on furniture markups, they might charge less up-front but you might over-pay on furnishings because incentives aren't aligned. Or if you try to furnish your property yourself without knowing where to draw the line with each space and each piece, it's easy to end up with a budget that balloons beyond what you can justify and what's gonna ROI.

What's more common is for investors to underspend. It's easy to think that the smart thing to do is to get the place furnished for as little as possible. But it's really easy to be penny wise and pound foolish here because a barebones furnishings budget makes it hard to stand out in your market, leading to lower ADR and occupancy rates. When people do book, cheap furnishings leave a bad taste and impact your re-bookings, referrals, and reviews, leading again to lower occupancy rates. Where things really get painful, though, is that cheap furnishings result in higher replacement costs long-term, so you can end up paying the same amount as someone who did it right but without any of the benefits.

### Mistake #2: Spending on the Wrong Things

But let's say you're a savvy investor and you've chosen a budget range that isn't too high or too low. You're still not through the woods, because you can still spend money on the wrong things.

See, when it comes to maximizing your ADR and occupancy, you need to understand that there are three critical stages in the guest journey where design makes or breaks your performance:

**First, you have to stop the scroll.**

When potential guests are browsing Airbnb or VRBO, your listing photos are competing with dozens of other properties. If you don't stand out compared to your competition, if people don't stop scrolling and click on your listing to get to your booking page, then they'll never book. It doesn't matter how great your property is if nobody ever sees it.

This is where strategic spending on high-impact visual elements becomes critical. You need spaces that photograph beautifully and have that "magazine effect" — where your photos look like they're straight out of Architectural Digest.

This comes down to making sure your design elements are cohesive, properly laid out, and that your finishing touches are in place. You'd be surprised how much your choice in curtain panels, throw pillows, or wall art can affect how many clicks you get on your listing — and how that flows directly into your occupancy rate.

**Second, you have to give people a reason to choose your property over other properties.**

Once they've clicked through to your listing, you need to convert that interest into a booking. This is where offering a unique experience becomes crucial. Themes are helpful for this. Making the space beautiful through cohesive design elements that are properly laid out matters here.

You want to create spaces that not only look stunning in photos but also signal to potential guests that staying at your property will be special — that it will give them the escape from the world they're looking for and help them form the kind of lasting memories they want to create with the people they love.

This is what allows you to command a higher ADR — because you're not just offering a place to sleep, you're offering an experience worth paying more for.

**Third, you have to make it memorable in a good way.**

This is about the actual experience when guests stay at your property. Because here's what most investors don't realize: your ADR and occupancy aren't just about getting people to book once. They're about getting them to rebook, leave glowing 5-star reviews that convert future guests and boost your ranking (which increases both your ADR potential and your occupancy), and refer their friends and family to your property.

And this is where spending on the wrong things can really hurt you.

Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner, was famous for using inversion as a problem-solving technique. He'd say: "Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there." In other words, figure out what causes failure, then do the opposite.

So let's invert: What makes a vacation rental property memorable in a BAD way?

Bad sleep. Uncomfortable mattresses. Scratchy sheets. Bedrooms that feel cramped or unwelcoming.

Inadequate seating. A property that sleeps 14 people but only has comfortable seating for 10. Dining tables that can't fit everyone for meals. Living spaces that force people to split up rather than come together.

Layouts that feel awkward or don't encourage socializing and memory-making.

These are the things that lead to mediocre reviews, one-time bookings, and properties that struggle to maintain healthy ADR and occupancy rates.

So if we want to do the OPPOSITE — if we want to make properties memorable in a GOOD way — we need to invest strategically in:

- Quality sleep experiences. Comfortable beds, good linens, bedrooms that feel cozy and inviting.
- Adequate and comfortable seating for the property's full capacity. Dining arrangements where everyone can share meals together. Living spaces that encourage conversation and togetherness.
- Layouts that naturally bring people together and create opportunities for those special vacation moments — the morning coffee conversations, the group dinners, the late-night game sessions.

When you invest in these things — when you spend on what actually matters to the guest experience — you create properties where people feel good. Where they make memories. Where they want to come back.

And THAT'S what drives re-bookings, 5-star reviews that boost your ranking and allow you to command higher rates, and referrals. That's what keeps your ADR and occupancy rate high year after year.

The truth is that investing in some items will move the needle more for your rental than others, so you want to spend strategically based on what actually impacts those three critical stages: stopping the scroll, converting browsers into bookers, and creating memorable experiences that generate long-term performance.

### Mistake #3: Spending Their Space Currency the Wrong Way

But let's assume you get some help choosing all of the items that are gonna go into your rental. You've got everything in the garage and inside you've got empty floors, blank walls, and bare windows. All of this blank space is your space currency — and how you spend it determines how your rental makes people feel when they scroll past it, decide whether or not to book it, and — importantly — how they feel when they stay in it and form memories that make them rebook it, recommend it, and leave glowing reviews that convert more visitors into bookings.

It's kind of like being handed a brush, a blank canvas, and a palette with blobs of paint on it chosen by someone who really understands color. You have all the pieces to make a great painting, but your skill as an artist is gonna determine how that painting ultimately makes people feel.

You can have the perfect budget and all the right pieces, but if you don't know how to arrange furniture to create inviting conversation areas, how to style surfaces to achieve that magazine effect, how to hang art at the right height and spacing, or how to layer textures to make spaces feel cozy and cohesive — your property will still underperform.

This is where a lot of DIY investors hit a wall. They've made good choices on budget and items, but the final result looks like a furniture showroom instead of a home. It doesn't photograph well. It doesn't make guests feel comfortable. And it doesn't drive the ADR and occupancy rates they need.

So we want to avoid these three mistakes if we want to maximize the ROI we get from investing in interior design.

## The ROI Design Method

Well, that's what we created the ROI Design Method for. It's our set of best practices around how to avoid the mistakes above and maximize your ROI in interior design so that you get the biggest increase in cash flow possible from increased ADR and occupancy rates — and consistent performance from your rental year after year.

The ROI Design Method has three core components that directly address the three mistakes we just covered:

**Strategic Budget** — knowing exactly how much to invest based on your market, your property type, and your financial goals.

**Strategic Spending** — knowing where to invest for maximum impact on stopping the scroll, converting bookings, and creating memorable experiences.

**Strategic Placement** — knowing how to arrange and style your space to create that magazine effect in photos and that welcoming, memory-making feeling in person.

If you stay until the end of this short video, I'm gonna give you this method in the form of a free toolkit that includes:

## The Tale of Three Properties

Those messages aren't just compliments — they're proof that the ROI Design Method works in the real world. And to really see why, it helps to look at the different approaches investors take when it comes to designing their properties.

Let me illustrate what that looks like with a story I call the Tale of Three Properties…

### Property 1: The Penny Pincher

This investor heard they can furnish their property for $50,000, all-in. They want to keep costs down, get it done fast, get the property online.

But here's what really happens:

To hit that number, they pinch pennies on furnishings and accessories. The property ends up looking like everyone else's. Generic. Forgettable. It doesn't stand out in search results, and it doesn't deliver a memorable experience in person.

The photos are flat. The space feels cheap. Guests scroll right past it — or worse, they book it once and never come back.

The result? The property sits at the bottom of the market in both ADR and occupancy. It's functional, but it's not compelling. And in a competitive market, that means it's bleeding potential revenue every single month — or operating in the red.

### Property 2: The Over-spender

On the other end of the spectrum, we have the over-spender. This can happen in two ways:

Sometimes they hire a designer who charges low upfront but makes real money on furniture markups — pushing expensive pieces that look great but don't actually drive more bookings.

Other times, the investor does it themselves and overspends because they don't know where to invest for maximum impact. They drop thousands on statement pieces that don't photograph well or don't matter to guests, while overlooking the details that actually drive clicks and conversions.

Either way, the budget balloons, but the ADR and occupancy don't budge proportionally. The property might be beautiful, but it's not strategically designed to win bookings. So they're doing better than the penny pincher, but not enough to justify the investment.

### Property 3: The ROI Design Investor

And then there's the ROI Design Investor.

This investor doesn't swing to either extreme. They're strategic. They know the goal isn't to spend the least or the most — it's to spend in the right places to maximize ADR and occupancy.

They use the ROI Design Method to:

- Invest strategically in the elements that stop the scroll and make properties irresistible in photos
- Design spaces that give potential guests a compelling reason to choose their property — through unique experiences, cohesive aesthetics, and that magazine effect — which allows them to command a higher ADR
- Create memorable experiences that generate 5-star reviews, re-bookings, and referrals — through quality sleep, adequate comfortable seating, and layouts that encourage memory-making — which drives higher occupancy and maintains their ADR premium
- Save in areas that don't affect bookability or guest satisfaction

Because here's the truth: the best investors know that success comes from judgment calls — where to push, where to pull back, and how to use every dollar to drive more nights booked at higher rates.

When those decisions are made wisely, the property doesn't just look amazing — it performs. It gets clicked on more. It gets booked more. It earns more 5-star reviews that improve its ranking and allow it to command premium rates. And it achieves both higher ADR and higher occupancy — the holy grail of vacation rental performance.

That's the difference between a property that struggles and one that becomes a top performer in your market. That's the difference between modest returns and substantial cash flow. That's the difference between stress and passive income.

## Fulfilling on the Intro's Promise

Now, let's circle back to that claim from the start — that following the right framework can help you maximize your cash flow by boosting your ADR and occupancy. Here's how the ROI Design Method actually delivers that:

**First: Photos That Stop the Scroll**

We design spaces that photograph exceptionally well — spaces with that magazine effect that makes people pause mid-scroll. That means more clicks, more interest, and more booking inquiries. If guests don't click, you don't get booked — period. This directly impacts your occupancy rate.

**Second: Design That Converts Browsers into Bookers and Justifies Premium Rates**

We create spaces that give potential guests a compelling reason to choose your property over the competition. Through strategic use of themes, cohesive design elements, and beautiful styling, we make your property stand out as the obvious choice. This not only increases your conversion rate (boosting occupancy) but also allows you to command a higher ADR because you're offering a clearly superior experience.

**Third: Experiences That Drive Reviews, Re-bookings, and Referrals**

We design for the guest experience in ways that make people feel something. Where they get great sleep. Where large groups can comfortably gather for meals and socializing. Where the layout naturally encourages them to make the kind of lasting memories they came on vacation to create. That translates directly into 5-star reviews, which boost your ranking and increase your visibility (driving more bookings), allow you to maintain or increase your ADR, plus re-bookings and referrals that keep your occupancy high.

**Fourth: Strategic Design That Maximizes Every Dollar**

We know exactly where to invest for maximum impact on both ADR and occupancy — and where you can save without hurting performance. That means:

- Trade discounts that lower your costs
- Smart sourcing that finds high-impact pieces at better prices
- Strategic choices that prioritize what actually drives revenue

Yes, we charge for our services, and we're not cheap. But our clients see the ROI clearly: higher ADR, higher occupancy, more revenue, and properties that outperform the market year after year.

It's kind of like hiring a great property manager who increases your bookings — except instead of taking a percentage every month, you invest once and reap the benefits for years.
